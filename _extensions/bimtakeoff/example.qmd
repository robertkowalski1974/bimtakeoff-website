# Introduction

This document demonstrates the **BIM Takeoff PDF format** - a custom Quarto extension that automatically applies our brand guidelines to PDF outputs.

## Key Features

The format includes the following brand-compliant features:

- **Typography**: Inter for headings, Lora for body text
- **Colors**: Orange (#FF9900) and Charcoal (#2C2C2C) throughout
- **Section Styling**: H2 headings with 3pt orange underlines
- **Professional Layout**: A4 paper with proper margins

## Typography Examples

### Heading Styles

This section (H2) has an orange underline as per brand guidelines.

#### Subheading in Orange

This H3 heading is displayed in orange to provide visual hierarchy.

### Body Text

Body text uses Lora font at 11pt with 1.6 line spacing for optimal readability in print documents. This follows our brand guideline of using **Inter for web** and **Lora for print**.

*Italic text* and **bold text** are both supported and maintain brand compliance.

## Lists with Orange Bullets

The format automatically styles lists with orange bullet points:

- First feature: Fast delivery (3-10 days)
- Second feature: High accuracy (±3-5%)
- Third feature: Professional output
  - Nested item with orange circle
  - Maintains brand consistency

Numbered lists also work perfectly:

1. Initial consultation
2. Data analysis
3. Cost estimation
4. Report delivery

## Callout Box Example

## Links and References

All hyperlinks are styled in orange for consistency: [Visit BIM Takeoff](https://bimtakeoff.com)

## Code and Technical Content

Technical content uses Monaco monospace font:

```python
# Example quantity takeoff calculation
total_area = length * width
unit_cost = 150.00
total_cost = total_area * unit_cost
print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost:,.2f}")
```

Inline code also works: `variable_name = "BIM Takeoff"`

## Table Example

| Service | Turnaround | Accuracy |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Cost Estimation | 3-5 days | ±3-5% |
