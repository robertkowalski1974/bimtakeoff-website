# Pricing Strategy Update - Polish Tender Winning Page
**Date:** November 22, 2024
**File:** `/pl/wygrywanie-przetargow.qmd`

## Issue Addressed
The strategic repositioning document suggested avoiding percentage-based pricing as a sign of weakness. However, the Polish page was using 3-5% of contract value pricing which seemed contradictory.

## Resolution & Rationale

After reviewing the strategic research, we found that:

1. **Percentage pricing (3-5%) IS industry standard** for tender winning services (not pure QS work)
2. The concern was about **how it's presented**, not the model itself
3. The strategic document actually includes this pricing in "Package 2: Complete Tender Service"

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Pricing Model Explanation Section
**New section:** "Modele Współpracy i Inwestycji"
- Explains WHY different pricing models exist
- Positions as "investment" not "cost"
- Shows flexibility and client-focus
- Emphasizes 8-10x ROI regardless of model

### 2. Enhanced Service Package Pricing

**Tender Rescue:**
- Added specific pricing: 25,000-40,000 PLN
- Clear, fixed pricing for urgent needs

**Complete Tender Service:**
- **Option A:** Fixed fee 60,000-150,000 PLN
- **Option B:** 3-5% of contract value (paid only on win)
- **Option C:** Hybrid model (50% upfront + success bonus)
- Minimum: 35,000 PLN

**Success Partnership:**
- Specific pricing: 15,000-25,000 PLN/month
- Shows savings: up to 40% vs. individual projects

### 3. Reframed ROI Calculation
Changed from simple percentage calculation to value-based presentation:
- Shows both fixed and percentage options
- Emphasizes "paid only when you win" for percentage model
- Lists what's delivered (40% win rate, contract protection, variation recovery)
- Message: "Every złoty returns 10-20 times"

### 4. Added FAQ About Pricing
New question: "Why different pricing models? Which is better?"
- Explains each model's benefits
- Shows understanding of different client situations
- Emphasizes same quality regardless of model chosen

## Strategic Alignment

This approach aligns with the research showing that successful tender consultancies:
- Offer **transparent pricing** (not "contact us for quote")
- Provide **multiple engagement models** 
- Show **risk-sharing options** (percentage model)
- Demonstrate **clear ROI** 

## Key Messaging Shift

From: "We charge 3-5% of contract value"
To: "Choose the investment model that works for you - fixed fee for predictability, success-based for shared risk, or hybrid for balance"

## Result

The pricing is now presented as:
1. **Value-focused** - what you get, not what you pay
2. **Flexible** - multiple options for different situations
3. **Transparent** - clear prices, no hidden fees
4. **ROI-driven** - emphasis on returns, not costs

This positions BIM Takeoff as a strategic investment partner, not a commodity service provider, while maintaining the industry-standard percentage option for those who prefer it.
