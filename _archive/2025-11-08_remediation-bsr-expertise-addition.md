## Why This Matters

The Building Safety Act 2022 represents the most significant change to UK building regulations in decades. For remediation projects involving Higher Risk Buildings:

1. **New Costs** - BSR compliance adds £20,000-60,000+ to project costs
2. **New Processes** - Gateway submissions, safety cases, competence verification
3. **New Risks** - Significant penalties for non-compliance
4. **New Complexity** - Multiple new professional roles and documentation requirements

By explicitly demonstrating BSR expertise, we:
- Differentiate from competitors who may not understand new regime
- Provide confidence to clients navigating complex regulations
- Justify premium pricing for specialist knowledge
- Position for long-term work as BSR regime matures

## Deployment
- Site rebuilt and deployed via `./deploy.sh`
- Changes pushed to GitHub Pages
