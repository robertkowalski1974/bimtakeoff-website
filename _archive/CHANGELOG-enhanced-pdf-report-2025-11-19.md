## Problem Identified

The PDF report generated by the ROI calculator was too basic, containing only:
- Cover page with 3 key metrics (Project Value, Savings, ROI)
- Contact information

This provided minimal value to prospects and didn't properly showcase BIM Takeoff's expertise or service offering.

---
