# Tender Winning Page Implementation
**Date:** November 22, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Preview

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Updates

**English (_quarto.yml):**
- Changed: "Portfolio" → "Tender Winning"
- Link: `coming-soon.qmd` → `tender-winning.qmd`

**Polish (pl/_quarto.yml):**
- Changed: "Portfolio" → "Wygrywanie Przetargów"
- Link: Remains `coming-soon.qmd` (PL version to follow)

### 2. New Page Created

**File:** `/tender-winning.qmd`

**Purpose:** Strategic overview page for the complete Tender Winning System - positions BIM Takeoff as a complete tender-to-payment partner rather than just a cost estimator.

**Key Differentiators from Bid Writing Page:**
- Tender Winning = STRATEGIC (why tenders fail, complete system, 4 pillars)
- Bid Writing = TACTICAL (the execution, 6-step process, detailed services)

### 3. Content Structure

**Tender Winning Page covers:**
1. Hero section with key stats (35-45% win rate, 500+ tenders, BIM-integrated)
2. "The Real Reason You're Losing Tenders" - data on why contractors fail
3. "The 70% Price Myth" - debunking price-only competition
4. Four Pillars System:
   - Intelligence (pre-bid strategy)
   - Documentation (winning submissions) → links to bid-writing-management
   - Protection (contract safeguards)
   - Recovery (variation/final account)
5. BIM Advantage section with quantified stats
6. Who We Work With (target client profiles)
7. Service Packages (Rescue, Complete, Partnership)
8. Investment Case comparison
9. FAQs
10. Free Tender Audit CTA

### 4. Strategic Alignment

Based on project knowledge documents:
- Construction_Tender_Winning_Strategies (research & data)
- BIM_Takeoff_Strategic_Repositioning_Complete (positioning strategy)

**Key positioning shift:**
- FROM: "BIM 5D Cost Estimation & Quantity Surveying Services"
- TO: "Your Tender Winning Department - Win 3× More Jobs | Better Margins | Less Risk"

### 5. Market Focus

This EN page is for:
- UK market
- Australian market
- International/EU contractors

**NOT Poland-specific** - Polish version (Wygrywanie Przetargów) will be created separately with culturally-adapted content.

## Next Steps
