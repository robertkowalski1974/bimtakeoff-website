# Stats Update: 90% Faster Delivery - October 26, 2025

## Problem
The stats bar on the English homepage showed "3-5 Days Turnaround" which could be misread as "35+ Days" and made the service appear slow. The Polish version already correctly emphasized the "90%" speed advantage.

## Solution
Changed the 4th stat on the English homepage to emphasize speed advantage rather than delivery time:

**Before:**
- Stat Number: `3-5`
- Stat Label: `Days Turnaround`

**After:**
- Stat Number: `90%`
- Stat Label: `Faster Delivery`

## Polish Version
Already had the correct messaging:
- Stat Number: `90%`
- Stat Label: `Redukcja Czasu Kosztorysowania` (Reduction in Estimation Time)

## Benefits of This Change
1. **Clearer messaging**: "90%" is instantly recognizable as a speed advantage
2. **Consistency**: Both EN and PL versions now emphasize the 90% speed benefit
3. **No misreading**: Can't be confused with "35+" anymore
4. **Competitive advantage**: Highlights efficiency over competitors
5. **Aligns with copy**: Matches the "90% faster than manual takeoffs" messaging throughout the site

## Files Modified
- `/Users/robertkowalski/Documents/bimtakeoff-website/index.qmd` (English homepage)

## Current Stats Bar (Both Versions)
1. **2000+** Projects Delivered / Zrealizowanych Projektów
2. **12M+** Square Meters Estimated / m² Wycenionych
3. **20+** Years Experience / Lat Doświadczenia
4. **90%** Faster Delivery / Redukcja Czasu Kosztorysowania
