## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Rushing Implementation
❌ **DON'T:** Try to launch all services in 1 week
✅ **DO:** Perfect one service at a time

### 2. Skipping QA
❌ **DON'T:** Launch without thorough testing
✅ **DO:** Test on multiple devices and browsers

### 3. Ignoring Mobile
❌ **DON'T:** Design desktop-first
✅ **DO:** Mobile-first approach (60%+ traffic is mobile)

### 4. Weak CTAs
❌ **DON'T:** Generic "Contact Us" buttons
✅ **DO:** Specific, action-oriented CTAs with clear value

### 5. No Tracking
❌ **DON'T:** Launch without analytics
✅ **DO:** Full tracking setup before launch

### 6. Copy-Paste Blindly
❌ **DON'T:** Use prompts without customization
✅ **DO:** Adapt to your specific projects and pricing

### 7. Forgetting Polish Translation
❌ **DON'T:** Launch EN version only
✅ **DO:** Always deploy bilingual (EN + PL)

### 8. No Lead Magnets
❌ **DON'T:** Rely solely on contact forms
✅ **DO:** Offer valuable downloads (guides, calculators)
