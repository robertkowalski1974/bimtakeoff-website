- **EWS1 Forms:** External Wall System certification
- **ACM Cladding:** Banned combustible material
- **Building Safety Fund:** Government funding for remediation

## Deployment
- Site rebuilt and deployed via `./deploy.sh`
- Changes pushed to GitHub Pages
- Live at: https://bimtakeoff.com/industries/remediation.html

## Notes
- Content structure mirrors other industry pages for consistency
- Specialized terminology for UK building safety regulations
- Higher contingency ranges (15-25%) to reflect unknown defect risks
