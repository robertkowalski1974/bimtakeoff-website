# Fix GitHub Remote Origin Error

## The Problem
Your git remote is pointing to the wrong URL (YOUR-USERNAME instead of robertkowalski1974)

## Solution - Run These Commands:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your directory
cd /Users/robertkowalski/Documents/bimtakeoff-website

# 2. Remove the incorrect remote
git remote remove origin

# 3. Add the correct remote with YOUR username
git remote add origin https://github.com/robertkowalski1974/bimtakeoff-website.git

# 4. Verify it's correct
git remote -v

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## IMPORTANT: Create the Repository First!

Before pushing, you MUST create the repository on GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `bimtakeoff-website`
3. Visibility: **Public**
4. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore)
5. Click "Create repository"

Then run the commands above!

## If You Get "Repository Not Found" Error

This means the repository doesn't exist on GitHub yet. Create it first (steps above), then push.
