## Why NOT the Other Solutions?

### ❌ EmailJS
**Pros:**
- Quick setup
- Good for simple contact forms

**Cons:**
- ❌ Leads don't go to CRM automatically
- ❌ You'd have to manually copy data to Pipedrive
- ❌ No follow-up automation
- ❌ No lead tracking
- ❌ Limited to 200 emails/month on free tier
- ❌ Template-only personalization

**When to use:** Only if you DON'T use a CRM and don't plan to

---

### ❌ FormSubmit
**Pros:**
- Ultra-simple (literally 5 minutes)
- Zero configuration

**Cons:**
- ❌ Just sends plain email
- ❌ No CRM integration
- ❌ No automation
- ❌ No tracking
- ❌ Generic emails (looks unprofessional)

**When to use:** Never for business-critical lead capture

---

### ❌ Custom Backend (Serverless Functions)
**Pros:**

**Cons:**
- ❌ User gets file instead of email
- ❌ No email follow-up possible
