# Polish Navbar Fix - JavaScript Solution

## Status: IMPLEMENTED

Since the Quarto build process wasn't applying the Polish configuration correctly, I've implemented a JavaScript-based solution that dynamically translates the navbar when Polish pages load.

## What I Did

### 1. Created JavaScript Translation Script
- **File**: `/js/polish-navbar.js`
- **Function**: Automatically detects Polish pages (`/pl/`) and translates navbar/footer text
- **Coverage**: All navbar items, dropdown menus, and footer text

### 2. Integrated Script into Polish Site
- Modified `pl/_quarto.yml` to include the script
- Script loads automatically on all Polish pages

### 3. Translations Included
- **Navbar**: Home → Strona Główna, Services → Usługi, Industries → Branże, etc.
- **Dropdowns**: All service and industry items translated
- **Footer**: All footer text translated to Polish

## How to Test

1. **Open the Polish page**: http://localhost:8000/pl/
2. **Check the navbar** - you should see:
   - "Strona Główna" instead of "Home"
   - "Usługi" instead of "Services"
   - "Branże" instead of "Industries"
   - "O Nas" instead of "About"
   - "Kontakt" instead of "Contact"

3. **Check dropdown menus** - hover over "Usługi" and "Branże" to see Polish translations
4. **Check the footer** - should show Polish text

## Deployment

To deploy this fix:

```bash
cd /Users/robertkowalski/Documents/bimtakeoff-website

# Make sure the js folder is copied to docs
cp -r js docs/

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add JavaScript-based Polish navbar translation"
git push origin main
```

## How It Works

1. The script checks if the current URL contains `/pl/`
2. If on a Polish page, it:
   - Finds all navbar menu items (`.menu-text` and `.dropdown-text`)
   - Replaces English text with Polish translations
   - Updates footer text
   - Sets the page language to Polish (`lang="pl"`)

## Advantages of This Solution

✅ **Works immediately** - no complex build process changes
✅ **Reliable** - doesn't depend on Quarto configuration
✅ **Easy to maintain** - translations in one JavaScript file
✅ **Fast** - translation happens instantly on page load
✅ **Fallback** - if script fails, English text remains (graceful degradation)

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/js/polish-navbar.js` - The translation script
2. `/pl/_quarto.yml` - Modified to include the script
3. `/docs/js/polish-navbar.js` - Copy for deployment

## Verification

The Polish page (http://localhost:8000/pl/) should now display:
- Polish navbar text
- Polish dropdown menus
- Polish footer
- Correct language attribute (`lang="pl"`)

## Note

This is a production-ready solution that works around Quarto's multilingual limitations. The JavaScript executes quickly and provides a seamless experience for Polish users.
