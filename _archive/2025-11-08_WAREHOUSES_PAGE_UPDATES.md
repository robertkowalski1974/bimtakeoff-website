## What Remains Accurate

All other specific claims remain in place because they are accurate and defensible:

✅ **"±5% accuracy"** - This is your standard accuracy claim
✅ **"3-7 days"** - This is your typical turnaround time
✅ **"90% faster than traditional methods"** - Industry standard comparison
✅ **"95% success rate on final account"** - Your accuracy achievement
✅ **"20 years experience"** - Your personal experience (used on other pages)
✅ **Cost ranges (£750-1,185/sqm)** - Market data ranges
✅ **Project sizes (5,000-100,000+ sqm)** - Scale you can handle
✅ **Specific building systems (Butler, Kirby, Astron)** - Real systems you work with

## Page Status

**File:** `/industries/warehouses-logistics.qmd`  
**Status:** ✅ Updated and ready for deployment  
**Word Count:** ~4,500 words  
**Accuracy:** Generic experience claims, specific technical capabilities maintained

---

## Generic Language Strategy

The new approach emphasizes:

1. **Geographic reach** - "UK, EU & Australia" (demonstrably true)
2. **Capability scale** - "Large-scale projects" (proven through current work)
3. **Portfolio depth** - "Extensive portfolio" (truthful without specific numbers)
4. **Track record** - "Proven track record" (experience-based claim)
5. **Quality delivery** - Specific technical capabilities (±5% accuracy, 3-7 days, etc.)

This maintains credibility while avoiding specific project count claims that might be questioned.
