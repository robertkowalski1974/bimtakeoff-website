## At a Glance Comparison

### 🏘️ RESIDENTIAL (Multi-family housing)
**Best for:** Apartment buildings, housing developments  
**Key characteristic:** High rework potential  
**Savings profile:** Higher rework savings, lower change orders

| Factor | Value | Ranking |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rework Multiplier | 1.3x | 🔴 Highest |
| Change Orders | 0.9x | 🟢 Lowest |
| Accuracy Impact | 1.0x | ⚪ Standard |
| Complexity | 0.9x | 🟢 Simple |
| **Typical Savings** | **Medium** | **#4 of 6** |

**Why?** Repetitive units mean more defects but simpler scope. BIM prevents mass reproduction of errors.

### 🏢 COMMERCIAL (Office, Retail)
**Best for:** Office buildings, shopping centers, hotels  
**Key characteristic:** High change orders  
**Savings profile:** Highest change order reduction, high accuracy value

| Factor | Value | Ranking |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rework Multiplier | 1.0x | ⚪ Baseline |
| Change Orders | 1.4x | 🔴 Highest |
| Accuracy Impact | 1.2x | 🟡 High |
| Complexity | 1.2x | 🔴 Complex |
| **Typical Savings** | **High** | **#2 of 6** |

**Why?** Client changes, fit-outs, and tenant requirements mean many change orders. BIM coordination prevents costly modifications.

### 🏭 INDUSTRIAL (Warehouse, Logistics)
**Best for:** Warehouses, factories, distribution centers  
**Key characteristic:** Low complexity  
**Savings profile:** Lower overall but still valuable

| Factor | Value | Ranking |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rework Multiplier | 0.8x | 🟢 Low |
| Change Orders | 0.7x | 🟢 Very Low |
| Accuracy Impact | 1.1x | ⚪ Good |
| Complexity | 0.8x | 🟢 Very Simple |
| **Typical Savings** | **Lower** | **#6 of 6** |

**Why?** Simple building types with stable scope = fewer problems. Still benefits from speed and large volume accuracy.

---

### 🌡️ THERMAL MODERNIZATION
**Best for:** Building retrofits, insulation, HVAC upgrades  
**Key characteristic:** Existing building risks  
**Savings profile:** High accuracy value (risk premium)

| Factor | Value | Ranking |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rework Multiplier | 1.2x | 🟡 High |
| Change Orders | 1.3x | 🟡 High |
| Accuracy Impact | 1.3x | 🟡 Very High |
| Complexity | 1.1x | ⚪ Moderate |
| **Typical Savings** | **High** | **#3 of 6** |

**Why?** Hidden conditions in existing buildings cause surprises. BIM scanning/modeling prevents costly discoveries mid-project.

---

### 🛣️ INFRASTRUCTURE
**Best for:** Roads, bridges, utilities, civil works  
**Key characteristic:** Massive scale  
**Savings profile:** Highest accuracy savings due to scale

| Factor | Value | Ranking |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rework Multiplier | 0.9x | 🟢 Low |
| Change Orders | 1.1x | ⚪ Moderate |
| Accuracy Impact | 1.4x | 🔴 Highest |
| Complexity | 1.3x | 🔴 Very Complex |
| **Typical Savings** | **Highest** | **#1 of 6** |

**Why?** Massive scale means small percentage errors = huge cost impacts. BIM accuracy multiplies across enormous quantities.

---

### 🏗️ MIXED-USE
**Best for:** Combined residential/commercial/retail  
**Key characteristic:** Coordination complexity  
**Savings profile:** Balanced higher savings across all areas

| Factor | Value | Ranking |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rework Multiplier | 1.1x | ⚪ Above Avg |
| Change Orders | 1.2x | 🟡 High |
| Accuracy Impact | 1.1x | ⚪ Good |
| Complexity | 1.2x | 🔴 Complex |
| **Typical Savings** | **High** | **#2-3 of 6** |

**Why?** Multiple use types = coordination challenges between different systems. BIM prevents interface problems.

## Sales Talking Points

### When to emphasize RESIDENTIAL
- "Your repetitive units multiply estimation errors. BIM prevents mass reproduction of mistakes."
- "Cooperative housing especially benefits - one error × 200 units = disaster."

### When to emphasize COMMERCIAL
- "Client changes are inevitable. BIM lets you price them accurately before commitment."
- "Fit-outs and tenant requirements change constantly - BIM keeps costs under control."

### When to emphasize INDUSTRIAL
- "Simple doesn't mean cheap to get wrong. Your scale means accuracy is still critical."
- "Fast delivery matters more than high complexity savings for your projects."

### When to emphasize THERMAL
- "Existing buildings are full of surprises. BIM scanning finds problems before tendering."
- "EU funding requires accurate estimates - BIM protects your grant applications."

### When to emphasize INFRASTRUCTURE
- "At your scale, ±1% accuracy = millions saved. BIM pays for itself on quantity precision alone."
- "Civil works have the highest accuracy requirements - BIM is your competitive advantage."

### When to emphasize MIXED-USE
- "Multiple trades, multiple budgets, multiple stakeholders = coordination nightmare. BIM is your lifeline."
- "Residential tower + retail podium + parking = interface problems. BIM prevents them."
