? £500 MILLION EVAPORATED IN 24 MONTHS

Between 2022-2024, every major UK modular housing manufacturer collapsed:

• Ilke Homes: £320M debt, £26k in the bank when administrators arrived
• Legal & General: £359M losses, "world's largest factory" shuttered  
• TopHat: £300M+ from Goldman Sachs - wound down
• House by Urban Splash: £43M debt, creditors got nothing

After 20 years in construction cost estimation, I've analyzed what really happened.

**The shocking part?** This is the THIRD time in 100 years this "revolutionary" technology has failed.

Meanwhile:
?? Sweden builds 84% of homes with prefab
?? UK manages barely 5-8%

Why such a massive gap?

The answer isn't technology failure. It's not poor execution.

It's a fundamental business model incompatibility that no amount of investment can solve.

**In my latest analysis, I reveal:**

? Why the economic model is fundamentally broken
? The hidden costs nobody talks about (£8k-12k per home in logistics alone)
? Where MMC actually succeeds (CitizenM hotels, data centers, bathroom pods)
? What Sweden and Japan do differently
? The uncomfortable conclusion after a century of trying

**The £500M lesson:** Sometimes traditional methods persist not because of industry resistance to innovation, but because they actually work better.

ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION (if above is too long):

£500M gone in 24 months. Every major UK modular manufacturer collapsed.

This is the THIRD time in 100 years this "revolutionary" technology has failed.

Meanwhile, Sweden builds 84% of homes with prefab. UK? Barely 5-8%.

After 20 years in construction, I've analyzed what really happened and why the business model is fundamentally broken.

The answer might surprise you—and it's not about technology.
