## Bottom Line Recommendation

**The Polish housing cooperative market may not be well-suited for LinkedIn paid advertising** at this stage. The combination of:

- Relationship-driven decision-making
- Committee-based purchasing
- Skepticism of international providers without local proof
- Limited understanding of BIM 5D value proposition
- High CPM due to narrow targeting

...suggests that **direct relationship-building and partnerships may be more effective** than paid ads for market entry.

**Recommended path:** Win 1-2 Polish projects through direct outreach, build case studies, then consider paid advertising with proof points in place.
