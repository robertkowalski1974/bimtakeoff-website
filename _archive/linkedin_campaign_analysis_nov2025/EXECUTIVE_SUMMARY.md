**Campaign:** Spółdzielnie - Tender Recovery  
**Period:** August 23 - November 20, 2025 (18 days)

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

- **Impressions:** 2,231
- **Clicks:** 11
- **Leads:** **0** (ZERO)
- **CTR:** 0.493% (slightly above benchmark ✓)
- **CPM:** £43.47 (45% above benchmark ⚠️)

### THE VERDICT
**Campaign has FAILED to generate any leads.** Despite acceptable click-through rate, the campaign suffers from:

2. High costs (CPM 45% above industry benchmark)
3. Zero social engagement (no reactions, comments, or shares)
4. Low absolute volume (only 11 clicks total)

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Within 24-48 Hours:
1. **PAUSE CAMPAIGN** - Stop budget drain
2. **AUDIT LEAD FORM** - Test on all devices, check functionality
3. **SIMPLIFY FORM** - Reduce fields to bare minimum
4. **FIX LANDING PAGE** - Add trust signals and Polish testimonials

### Do NOT restart campaign until:
- [ ] Lead form tested and verified working
- [ ] At least 3 new ad creatives developed
- [ ] Targeting expanded significantly
- [ ] Polish case study added
- [ ] Alternative offer created (beyond free audit)

## 📊 CREATIVE PERFORMANCE

### Ad 1 (Nov 9) - "Problem-Focused"
- Budget: £82.69 (85%)
- Impressions: 1,771
- Clicks: 9 (CTR: 0.508%)
- CPM: £46.69 ⚠️
- **Leads: 0**

Ad 2 shows better cost efficiency but sample size too small for conclusions.

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why This Failed:

1. **Market Mismatch**
   - Polish housing cooperatives are relationship-driven
   - LinkedIn ads are transactional
   - Cultural preference for proven local providers
   - Committee-based decision-making (slow)

2. **Message Problems**
   - Problem-focused copy feels aggressive
   - "Free audit" requires too much commitment
   - No Polish social proof/case studies
   - Missing trust signals for international provider

3. **Technical Issues**
   - Lead form may not work properly
   - Landing page lacks credibility elements
   - Mobile experience possibly broken
   - Form questions may be inappropriate

4. **Targeting Challenges**
   - Audience too narrow (drives high CPM)
   - May not be reaching actual decision-makers
   - Limited scale in Polish cooperative market
   - Competition for small audience pool

## 🤔 THE BIG QUESTION

**Should you invest more in LinkedIn ads for Polish cooperatives?**

**My assessment:** Probably NOT without major changes.

**Why:**
- Polish B2B construction is relationship-based
- Housing cooperatives are risk-averse, committee-driven
- International provider needs local proof points first
- Better channels exist for this market

**Better approach:**
1. Win 1-2 Polish projects through direct outreach
2. Build case studies and testimonials
3. Get referrals from successful projects
4. Then consider paid advertising with proof

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

**Decision Point:** Choose your path forward:

**Path 1:** Fix campaign and give it proper 3-month test (£450 investment, moderate risk)  
**Path 2:** Pivot to Google Ads + direct outreach (£500/month, lower risk) ✅  
**Path 3:** Go fully organic and relationship-based (minimal cost, long timeline)
