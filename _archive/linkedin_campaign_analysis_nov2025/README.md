## 💡 Key Takeaways (30-Second Version)

**What Happened:**
- Spent £97
- Got 2,231 impressions
- 11 clicks (CTR: 0.49% - slightly above benchmark ✓)
- **0 leads** (0% conversion 🚨)

**Why It Failed:**
1. Lead form not converting (technical issue or too much friction)
2. Audience too narrow (CPM 45% above benchmark)
3. No social proof for Polish market
4. Message not resonating (0 reactions, comments, shares)

**What To Do:**
- **Option 1:** Fix everything and retest (£450/3 months, medium risk)
- **Option 2:** Pivot to Google Ads + direct outreach (£500/month, lower risk) ✅
- **Option 3:** Go fully organic/relationship-based (minimal cost, 6-12 month timeline)

**Bottom Line:**
Polish housing cooperatives may not be ideal for LinkedIn paid ads at this stage. Relationship-building and direct outreach may be more effective for market entry.

## 🤔 Questions to Consider

Before deciding next steps, think about:

1. **Do you need Polish cooperative clients specifically?**
   - Or can you focus on other segments first?

2. **Do you have time for 6-12 month organic approach?**
   - Or do you need leads in next 90 days?

3. **Can you get 1-2 Polish projects through direct outreach?**
   - To use as case studies for future advertising?

4. **Is £450-500/month a meaningful budget?**
   - Or do you need to see results with less investment?

5. **Are relationships or transactions more valuable?**
   - Polish market seems relationship-driven
