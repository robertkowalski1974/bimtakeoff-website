# Animated Hero Background - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for video file

## What I've Done

I've set up your website to support an **animated video background** with moving cranes and clouds, just like your original bimtakeoff.com website.

## Current Setup ✅

### 1. CSS Updated (`css/styles.css`)
- ✅ Video background container styling
- ✅ Full-screen video that covers hero section
- ✅ Dark overlay (75% opacity) for text readability
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-optimized)
- ✅ Fallback to static image if video doesn't load

### 2. HTML Updated (`index.qmd`)
- ✅ Video element added to hero section
- ✅ Autoplay, loop, and muted attributes
- ✅ Multiple video format support (MP4 + WebM)
- ✅ Poster image fallback

### 3. Documentation Created
- ✅ `ANIMATED_BACKGROUND_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup guide
- ✅ `css-animated-alternative.css` - CSS-only animation option

## What You Need to Do

### STEP 1: Get Your Video File

**Option A: Extract from your current website**
1. Open www.bimtakeoff.com in Chrome
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Network tab → Filter by "Media"
4. Reload page and look for .mp4 or .webm files
5. Download the video

**Option B: Use stock video**
Search on Pexels or Pixabay for:
- "construction time lapse"
- "crane building site"
- "construction site clouds"

**Option C: Create your own**
- Film a construction site timelapse
- Combine photos into a video

### STEP 2: Add Video to Your Site

1. Save your video file as:
   ```
   /Users/robertkowalski/Documents/bimtakeoff-website/images/hero-video.mp4
   ```

2. Rebuild your site:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/robertkowalski/Documents/bimtakeoff-website
   quarto render
   ```

3. Preview:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```

## Alternative: CSS-Only Animation

If you can't find the video right away, use the CSS-animated version:

1. Open `css-animated-alternative.css`
2. Copy its contents
3. Replace the video background section in `styles.css`
4. Remove the video element from `index.qmd`
5. Rebuild

**This gives you:**
- Subtle animated gradient
- Moving overlay effect
- Floating particles (simulating dust/construction)
- No video file needed
- Fast loading

## Video Specifications

For best results, your video should be:

✅ **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)  
✅ **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (Full HD)  
✅ **Duration:** 10-30 seconds (loops seamlessly)  
✅ **File Size:** Under 5MB  
✅ **Frame Rate:** 24-30 fps  
✅ **Audio:** None (muted for autoplay)  

## Current Behavior

**With video file:**
- ✅ Animated construction background plays automatically
- ✅ Loops continuously
- ✅ Muted (required for autoplay)
- ✅ Dark overlay keeps text readable
- ✅ Static image shows while loading

**Without video file:**
- ✅ Shows static construction image (header-background.jpg)
- ✅ Dark gradient overlay
- ✅ All text remains readable
- ✅ No errors

## Next Steps

1. **Find/create your animated video** (moving cranes, clouds)
2. **Save it** as `images/hero-video.mp4`
3. **Rebuild** your site
4. **Test** that it works as expected

OR

1. **Use CSS-animated version** (see `css-animated-alternative.css`)
2. **Get video later** and swap it in when ready
