### 3. **Added Emphasis on Firestopping & Facade Remediation**

- Detailed expertise in:
  - Fire barriers (przepony ogniowe) EI 60-240
  - Penetration seals and fire stopping
  - Facade systems (ETICS, ventilated, ceramic)
  - Fire safety systems integration
- Positioned as core specialization throughout the page

### 4. **Polish Market Adaptations**

- Polish terminology:
  - "Przepony ogniowe" (fire barriers)
  - "Termomodernizacja" (thermal modernization)

  - "Kosztorysowanie" (cost estimation)

## Content Highlights

- Positioned for SEO with Polish keywords

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Review technical terminology with Polish construction expert
2. Verify all internal links resolve correctly
3. Add actual Polish phone number (placeholder used)
4. Consider adding Polish case studies/references
5. SEO optimization for Polish search terms


## UPDATE - Section Deletion (Same Day)

### Removed Section
Deleted the entire "Ekspertyza w Ogniochronie i Remediacji Elewacji" section as requested by user.

### Rationale
- Section was too detailed and specific
- User preferred more concise presentation
- Maintains mentions of firestopping and facade expertise in hero section and service cards
- Keeps page focused on core value proposition without excessive technical detail

### What Remains
- Hero section still mentions: "Specjaliści od przepon ogniowych" and "Eksperci remediacji elewacji"
- Service cards still reference fire safety compliance and facade systems
- "Why Choose BIM Takeoff" section maintains specialist knowledge points
- Overall expertise is communicated without dedicated detailed section
