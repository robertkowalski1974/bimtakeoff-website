## The Myth That Costs Contractors Work

::: {.callout-box style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff8f0 0%, #ffe8d6 100%); border-left: 4px solid var(--bim-orange);"}
The claim that "70% of construction tender scoring is based on price" is **fundamentally misleading**. It represents only one point on a diverse spectrum of evaluation approaches—and not even a common one. Poland legally prohibits price exceeding 60%. UK best practice uses 60% quality, 40% price. The 70:30 price/quality split is specifically criticized in New Zealand research as making quality evaluation "largely pointless."
:::

Contractors who believe they must compete primarily on price are leaving work on the table. With **40-50% of tender evaluation based on non-price criteria**, technically superior contractors can win despite higher pricing—if they know how to demonstrate their value.

This analysis examines actual tender evaluation frameworks across Poland, UK, Australia, and EU markets, revealing the strategies that measurably improve win rates. The data shows cost estimation accuracy is the #1 factor, BIM capabilities add 5-9% to winning probability, and winners invest 25% more in bid preparation than losers.

## The Real Evaluation Landscape: Market-by-Market

::: {.feature-grid}
::: {.feature-card}
### Poland (EU Member State)

- Open competitive: 10-20% win rates
- BREEAM credentials critical for Panattoni/Goodman/7R
- Innovation and value engineering highly rewarded
:::

::: {.feature-card}
### The Opportunity
**40-50% Non-Price Evaluation = Differentiation Space**

- Technical methodology: 20-30% of score
- Past performance: #1 ranked criterion
- Risk management: Builds trust
- BIM capability: 5-9% win rate improvement
:::
:::

::: {.callout-box style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f0f8ff 0%, #d6ebff 100%); border-left: 4px solid #0066cc;"}
**Critical Finding:** The evidence reveals price weighting typically ranges 30-70% across jurisdictions, varying by project complexity, procurement framework, and contract type. Simple greenfield construction may see 70-90% price weighting, while complex design-build projects commonly use 40-60% price with quality and social value comprising the remainder.

### The #1 Factor: Cost Estimation Accuracy

Research consistently identifies **cost estimation accuracy as the #1 reason for tender failures**. The data is compelling:

::: {style="margin: 32px 0; padding: 24px; background: var(--bim-light-gray); border-radius: 8px;"}
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Contractors using local market data | "Consistently outperform those relying on national averages" |
| National average error rates | 30-40%+ variance from actual costs |
| Enhanced cost accuracy projects | 3% cost growth vs 6% national average (50% reduction) |
| Win rate improvement | From 20-25% baseline to 35-50% |
:::

Accurate cost estimation builds client confidence through transparent, defensible pricing using objective third-party data. It reduces room for disputes, demonstrates technical due diligence, and lowers perceived risk profile.

### BIM's Quantified Impact

Saudi Arabia research on 122 projects found BIM strategy increases winning probability by **9.42% for Quality-Based Selection** projects and **5.5% for Cost-Based Selection** projects. UK data shows less than 1/3 of projects provide BIM models at tender stage—creating competitive advantage for BIM-capable contractors.

Benefits cited include better design interrogation, improved clash detection, more accurate quantity takeoffs, enhanced programming, faster tendering, and more robust methodology statements.

## The Evaluation Criteria Hierarchy

Research consistently ranks evaluation criteria importance as:

</div>

Norwegian Best Value Procurement models allocate **25% for execution methodology + 15% for risk assessment** (40% combined) vs. only 25% for price. Structured interviews for key personnel provide the highest level of differentiation—statistically more important than price.

## The 5D BIM Tender Advantage

5D BIM integrates 3D model, 4D scheduling, and 5D cost data to create compelling visual narratives that build client confidence. The technology enables differentiation that traditional 2D submissions cannot match.

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 24px; margin: 32px 0;"}
::: {style="padding: 24px; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-left: 4px solid var(--bim-orange);"}
### Construction Sequence Visualization

4D BIM animations show evaluators exactly how you'll build the project. Case study: Solid Support won Australia's first diagonal arch bridge tender with SYNCHRO 4D animation demonstrating their methodology.

### Method Statement Animations

Fuzor and SYNCHRO enable high-quality construction methodology visualizations that communicate complex sequences clearly to non-technical evaluators.
:::
:::

## What Clients Want in Technical Methodology

Methodology sections typically receive **20-30% of total evaluation weight**. Essential elements include:

### Project-Specific Approach

Demonstrate understanding of unique challenges specific to the project. Address site-specific constraints explicitly. Show awareness of sensitive issues (schools require safeguarding protocols, hospitals require infection control). Avoid generic copy-paste—customize every submission.

### Construction Sequence & Phasing

Provide visual 4D simulation showing construction stages. Identify critical path and mitigation strategies. Show temporary works clearly. Detail logistics planning including deliveries, crane operations, and storage. Demonstrate interface management between trades.

### Resource Deployment Detail

Present detailed labor, plant, and equipment breakdown. Identify key personnel with defined roles. Explain subcontractor management strategy and supply chain coordination approach.

### Schedule Detail Guidelines

Activity duration should not exceed interval between updates. For monthly updates: no single activity over 1 month. Tender stage typically requires AACE Level 2-3 (intermediate detail showing major work packages). Include key milestones, lead times for long-lead items, procurement periods, and interface points.

### Innovation & Value-Add

Demonstrate Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) where appropriate. Show technology deployment such as drones and IoT sensors. Present sustainability initiatives. Quantify time or cost savings through innovation.

## Risk Management: Building Client Confidence

::: {.callout-box style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e8f5e9 0%, #c8e6c9 100%); border-left: 4px solid #4caf50;"}
**Counter-Intuitive Truth:** Transparent risk identification builds trust rather than raising concerns. Comprehensive risk management demonstrates proactive planning vs. reactive problem-solving, technical sophistication and experience, realistic understanding of project challenges, and credible mitigation strategies.
:::

### Effective Risk Register Components

Present risks in structured format covering risk identification with clear descriptions (site-specific, technical, financial, schedule, supply chain), likelihood and impact ratings using matrix visualization, proposed mitigation measures with specific actions, residual risk after mitigation, risk ownership assignment, and contingency provisions quantified where possible.

Link risk mitigation directly to methodology—show how your technical approach specifically addresses identified risks. Reference how similar risks were managed on past projects with measurable outcomes.

## Value Engineering: Demonstrating Innovation

Value engineering proposals show cost consciousness and innovation without compromising quality.

## Investment That Pays for Itself

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 24px; margin: 32px 0;"}
::: {style="padding: 24px; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); text-align: center;"}
### Baseline Scenario
**20 bids/year at 20% win rate**

= 4 project wins
:::

::: {style="padding: 24px; background: white; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); text-align: center; border: 2px solid var(--bim-orange);"}
### With Enhanced Preparation
**20 bids/year at 35% win rate**

= 7 project wins (+3 additional)
:::
:::

Each additional £10M project won delivers significantly more value than bid preparation costs. Service investment pays for itself with **a single additional win** on most projects.

**Winners invest 0.65% of project value** in bid preparation vs. 0.48% for losers. For a £10M project, that's £65,000 vs. £48,000—a £17,000 difference that could determine whether you win £10M in revenue.
